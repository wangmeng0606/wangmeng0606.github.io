Finally, I got Ph.D. degree from the University of Houston. I can be offically called as "Dr. Wang".  I extend my heartfelt thanks for Dr. Rodrigues guidance and support. Her wisdom and advice have been instrumental in shaping my career choices, and I am grateful for the opportunity to benefit from her knowledge.
