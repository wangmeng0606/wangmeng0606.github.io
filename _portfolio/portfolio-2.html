Superhydrophilic or hydrophobic coatings have been shown to affect the nucleation energy barrier, resulting in attenuation of the nucleation and deposition of minerals on the surface. To date, the underlying scaling mechanisms on different organic coatings have been extensively studied to demonstrate that the surface functional groups, the surface hydrophilicity, and ion adsorption  can control the formation of mineral scaling. Moreover, the inertia of hydrophilic and neutrally charged surface coatings to inorganic scalants has been proposed.  Therefore, numerous hydrophilic coating materials for the membrane and other surfaces including graphene oxide (GO),  poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),  and zwitterionic (ZI) polymers  have been developed. ZI polymers possess equal numbers of positively and negatively charged zwitterionic functional groups, which make them known for excellent hydration capacities and antifouling properties. In addition to the hydrophilicity, ZI polymers also have other properties (i.e., neutral charge), which might contribute to the scaling-resistant performance. However, how the properties of ZI polymers would affect mineral scaling has not been explored thoroughly.

Other studies of how ZI materials interact with natural water sources typically focused on organic fouling rather than scaling. ZACs, which are made of a hydrophobic monomer (e.g., trifluoroethyl methacrylate, TFEMA) with a ZI monomer, have been studied as membrane coatings or selective layers. These ZACs exhibit size-selective permeation of solutes and are extremely resistant to fouling by a broad range of wastewater sources containing oil emulsions, common foulants in surface water and municipal wastewater, and when treating textile wastewater. This is believed to be due to the excellent self-association and hydration capabilities of ZI monomers in the copolymer structure. Dudchenko et al. investigated the effects of chemically heterogeneous ZAC coatings on organic foulant adsorption by changing the weight percent of the ZI monomer in the copolymer structure. This work indicated that surface hydrophilicity is not sufficient for explaining the foulant adsorption on ZAC coatings, and the heterogeneity of surfaces due to the microphase separation of ZACs likely contributes to their interaction with organic foulants. These studies demonstrate the potential of ZAC coatings for organic fouling resistance. ZACs also exhibit a self-assembled, chemically heterogeneous structure that may further influence calcium sulfate scaling formation. The effects of these features are still not fully understood.

We investigated the scaling mechanisms of different types of ZI amphiphilic copolymers (ZACs) synthesized from diverse combinations of zwitterion monomers and hydrophobic monomers using free-radical polymerization (FRP). The selected ZACs included poly(trifluoroethyl methacrylate-random-sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PTFEMA-r-SBMA, shortened as PT:SBMA), poly(trifluoroethyl methacrylate-random-2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PTFEMA-r-MPC, shortened as PT:MPC), poly(methyl methacrylate-random-sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PMMA-r-SBMA, shortened as PM:SBMA), and poly(methyl methacrylate-random-2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMMA-r-MPC, shortened as PM:MPC). Coatings of these polymers were tested for calcium sulfate (CaSO4) scaling in simulated brackish water solutions with different saturation indices, defined as the logarithm of the actual dissolved ion product (Q, i.e., calcium and sulfate ions) normalized by the solubility constant of gypsum (Ksp). These experimental results indicated that at high saturation indices (SI), the scaling deposition on ZAC coatings mainly depended on the surface energy. Therefore, PT:SBMA coatings, which had the lowest surface energy, exhibited better-scaling resistance. At lower SI, the hydrophilicity of the ZAC coatings was the dominant factor. Since ZAC coatings containing MPC have higher surface hydrophilicity, they might have a relatively slower scale-forming ion adsorption rate compared to SBMA containing ZACs, thus not markedly enriching the scale-forming ion near MPC coating surfaces and hence inhibiting heterogeneous CaSO4 precipitates.
