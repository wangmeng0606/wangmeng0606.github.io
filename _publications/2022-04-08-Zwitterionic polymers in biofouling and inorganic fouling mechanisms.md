This paper reviewed Zwitterionic polymers in biofouling and inorganic fouling mechanisms

Abstract: Zwitterionic polymers are a relatively novel group of polymers that have gained significant attention in recent years, owing to their versatility and usefulness in a variety of applications but specifically in the water filtration field. These polymers are characterized by the presence of an equal number of negative and positive charges giving them a net neutral charge. This chapter will first elaborate on the different mechanisms of synthesis and processes of grafting zwitterionic polymers onto membranes and then discuss how these zwitterionic polymers, grafted or not into membranes, interact with multiple types of substrates, that is, organic, inorganic, and biomolecules, to prevent different mechanisms of fouling.
Keywords: Zwitterionic polymers; biofouling; inorganic fouling; polymers; zwitterions; antifouling; antiscalant
